# Basic-Visualitation
First assignment of Hacktiv8 course. This assignment is example of data visualization in Python. For this assignment, as required, mainly using Matplotlib library to visualize data.
Since the dataset size is more almost 1 Gb (exceeds github 25 MB limit), you can find the data set in Kaggle. This assignment is pretty straightforward, is how you visualize the data using matplolib library. Since the requirement is using matplotlib, you can always use Seaborn instead (for example).
